# Hotel project

The project is to create a hotel booking system for a small hotel. We are going to create a desktop application using JavaFX and connect it to a MySQL database. The system should work for a hotel with about 20 -- 80 rooms, but we want to make it as flexible as possible. The program is only going to be used by staff at the hotel, never by the guests, but there are two types of staff -- reception staff and administrators -- with different privileges. Below, "user" means both user types, otherwise they are specified.
